## What is SCOPE in JavaScript ?

The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions
are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current
scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a  hierarchy, 
so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.
